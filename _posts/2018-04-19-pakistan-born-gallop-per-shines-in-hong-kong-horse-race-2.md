Pakistan born gallop-per shines in Hong Kong horse race.
<blockquote>On March 2, 2013, a star was born. Pakistan Star started life at Gestüt Wittekindshof in Sauerland, Germany. We recount the cult hero’s path from raw talent, internet sensation and a racecourse ban for sensationally stopping mid-race – all the while building his status in becoming Hong Kong’s most popular racehorse.

This is the Pakistan Star story so far, in the words of people who have seen it first hand.</blockquote>
