<h3>Akmal Show</h3>
Peshawar Zalmi had already beaten Quetta Gladiator in their last match in Lahore. They continued their form in the second eliminator as well. They set a seemingly unreachable total of 170 in 16 overs. Overs were reduced due to rain delays. Peshawar Zalmi started strong with Kamran Akmal and ADS Fletcher, a starting partnership of 107 run. Then Zalmi went to add 63 more runs to setup 170 run total on board. Kamran Akmal scored 77 runs of 27 balls.

Karachi Kings had a difficult total to chase. They needed run rate of 10 run per over at the start of inning. This run rate kept on increasing as the inning proceeded. JL Denly and Babar Azam tried to push Karachi King into the final with a partnership of more than 100 runs. Denly scored 79 of 46 balls and 63 of 45 balls. The run rate kept on mounting. In the final hour 26 run were needed on 6 balls.

Karachi lost by 23 run to Peshawar Zalmi.
