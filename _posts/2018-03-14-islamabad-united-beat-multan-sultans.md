This one was a high scoring match in which Islamabad United set an strong target of 185 runs. Multan Sultan after having good run of form in first few matches seem to be losing its winning touch. Multan Sultan lost easy wickets and thanks to KA Pollard 73 were saved from a humiliating defeat but still fell short of target at 152 runs.

Islamabad United on the other hand played like veteren of PSL. Islamabad United is also the winners of first PSL tournement under the captaincy of Misbah-ul-Haq. L Ronchi came with good run of form recently and scored 58 of 36 balls giving Islamabad United a very strong start. Then AD Hales and Hussain Talat built upon the good start to set the target of 185 for the new comers.

From bowling side, for Multan Sultan Umar Gul and Imran Tahir bagged 3 wickets. For Islamabad United SR Patel, Faheem Ashraf,  Ahmad Butt, Shadab Khan bagged couple each and Muhammad Sami took the wicket of KA Pollard.

Islamabad United have now confirmed their spot in PlayOffs. Multan Sultan are hopeful that Peshawar Zalmi will loose one of their remaining matches give Multan Sultan a chance.
