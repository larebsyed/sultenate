<h4>Jeremy McLellan Shuts Up India</h4>
American comedian Jeremy McLellan has been using his social media profiles to condemn the violence being perpetrated by India in Kashmir.

The Indian media has claimed that Jeremy is being paid by Pakistan to make such comments.

Jeremy shared some of the screenshots of the tweets he received from Indians.
<blockquote><a href="http://sultenate.com/2018/04/islamabad-new-iconic-y-airport-is-live">New Islamabad International Airport is funtional</a></blockquote>
He responded to them with this. #burn
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Indian trolls,</p>
If Pakistan was paying me to tweet, I’d have a much nicer car and house.

Sincerely,
Agent Jeremy <a href="https://t.co/qL7c7gJjEc">https://t.co/qL7c7gJjEc</a>

When one indian tried to hold him accountable for US occupation in Pakistan and Afganistan, he responded.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">How many innocents have I killed? Zero. My government, on the other hand, has killed a lot, and I’ve spoken out against it from the beginning. You should try it sometime. <a href="https://t.co/z07tTHOhN1">https://t.co/z07tTHOhN1</a></p>

McLellan had visited Pakistan to explore the country through his own eyes and not the eyes of media. He had performed in Lahore and Islamabad in Universities like National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST). He had enjoyed his visit in Pakistan and tweeted a lot about Pakistani food and people.
