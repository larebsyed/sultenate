<h6>Pakistan Squad for tour of England: Wahab Riaz not in Squad, Fawad Alam not given a chance</h6>
Shan Masood misses out because of knee injury, no place for experienced pacer Wahab Riaz within the 16-member squad for the tour of Ireland and England.

Pakistan named a mixture of youth and experience for their tour of Ireland and England, that begins within the second week of May.

Fakhar zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Usman Sallahuddin and Saad Ali received maiden test call-ups. Shan Masood, the opener, misses out because of a knee injury whereas there was no place for experienced pacer Wahab Riaz within the 16-member squad declared by Inzamam-ul-Haq, the Pakistan Cricket Board chief selector, on Sunday 15 April.

Faheem Ashraf, the uncapped all-rounder, was also included within the test squad on the back of some spectacular performances within the shorter formats of the sport. His medium pace is going to be a helpful addition in seamer-friendly conditions.

Imam, the 22-year-old nephew of Inzamam who scored a century on his ODI debut against Sri Lanka late last year, was given an opportunity within the longer format of the sport.

Ali has been in stellar kind in Pakistan's excellent circuit, having scored 3,473 runs in fifty games at a formidable 46.93. His highest score of 232 came earlier this season.

Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Sami Aslam and Babar Azam form the crux of the batting unit with Sarfraz Ahmed captaining the side and keeping wicket.

Mohammad Amir can lead a comparatively inexperienced pace attack, which has Hasan Ali, Mohammed Abbas and Rahat Ali.

Pakistan are going to be without the services of Yasir Shah, who misses out because of a hip injury. trying to make up for his absence are Shadab Khan, who has played a solitary test, against the Windies last year. Shadab is the only specialist spin-bowling possibility within the squad, with Haris Sohail's part-time slow left-arm orthodox probably a helpful addition.

"Yasir's absence may be a huge loss for us," aforementioned Inzamam. "If we glance at his numbers for the last 2 years, he has a lot more wickets than the other bowler for Pakistan. He was our strike bowler, all the games we've won he contend an enormous part in. I hope he recovers quickly from his injury because we've some big home test series turning out after this series too, and that we would like him within the UAE."

Pakistan begin their tour with a four-day tune-up game against Kent before taking part in a historic one-off test against ireland. The match on 11 may in national capital are going to be Irelandâ€™s 1st ever. Pakistan then jaunt England for a two-Test series starting on 24 may at Lord's.
