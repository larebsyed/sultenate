This time PTI and PPP are not backing the same candidate.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">"Leader of the opposition is a member of the House who enjoys the support of the majority of the members in opposition to the government in the House, and is declared as such by the Chairman of the Senate. the Chairman declares a member as Leader of Opposition having the support of majority members. He/she so declared looses the office as soon as the support is withdrawn."</span></p>
PPP are looking to nominate Sherry Rehman for the post while PTI will back Senator Azam Swati for the leader of opposition in Senate.

Lets see how this unfolds. Stay tuned. Like our facebook page.
