Zalmi had a bad start to the inning when in form batsman, Kamran Akmal went back to stands after scoring a duck. But Dawson stabilized the inning with 62 of 35 balls.

Peshawar Zalmi set&nbsp; a target of 157 runs for Quetta Gladiator

Quetta Gladiator also had poor start, losing a wicket on the first ball. But soon with Muhammad Nawaz and Skipper Sarfaraz on the crease, the gladiator looked well on the way for the victory. But their march was stopped abruptly when both Nawaz and Sarfraz lost their wicket on consecutive victory.

Afterwards, it was a just upward battle for Gladiators with wickets falling in constant intervals. In the last over the Gladiator were 25 run short with Anwer Ali on the batting end, match almost seemed wrapped up. But Anwar Ali made a dying effort with 3 sixes and 4 to bring the match to 3 runs on last ball.

Unfortunately, he was not able to score a boundary on last ball to secure the win. Nevertheless, his efforts was commendable.
