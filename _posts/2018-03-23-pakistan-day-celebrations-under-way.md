ISLAMABAD: The 78th Pakistan Day is being celebrated at Parade Ground, Shakarparian.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena is the guest of honour at the event.

Upon arrival, President Mamnoon Hussain was received by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi after which he inspected the parade.

New-appointed air chief, Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan, then led a fly-past, followed by several other squadrons of the Pakistan Air Force as a salute to the head of the state.

The president then addressed the nation and praised the country's people and armed forces for their resolve.

Later, the armed forces' contingents began the parade, saluting the chief guests as they passed by. They included various units and formations of the armed forces.

Contingents from the armed forces of Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Jordan also participated in the parade.

Following the military segment, various troupes depicting the country's culture conducted the parade.

The heads of all three armed forces of the country — army, navy and air force —, as well as the joint chiefs' chairman, are present at the parade, as is Defence Minister Khurram Dastgir-Khan and Safron Minister Abdul Qadir Khan.

An award ceremony is also on the agenda for later in the day, to be held at Aiwan-e-Sadar, where the president will be conferring awards to various personalities on their contribution to different fields.

Earlier in the day, special prayers were offered in mosques after Fajr for the progress, prosperity and solidarity of the country, and the national flag was hoisted on major government buildings.
