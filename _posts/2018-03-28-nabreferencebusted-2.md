<h4>Nawaz vs NAB</h4>
JIT Head has stated that he has not been able to find any documented prove of connection between Nawaz Sharif and Avenfield flats.  This statement was made when the lawyer of Mr. Nawaz Sharif asked Wajid Zia about document of evidence.

Zia told court that JIT had received documents of Nielsen and Nescoll offshore companies' trust deeds. JIT had  sent the documents of  trust deeds to Radley Forensic Labs for examination.

The company after thorough examination of the documents had declared them fake.

NAB has filed three references against Sharif Family, Avenfield Flats reference was on of them. Other two are Flagship reference and Al-Azizia reference
