India is constantly breaching the Human Rights in the conflicted Kashmir. Recently, 20 people are killed and another 200 are injured due to violence of Indian security forces. It isÂ unexplainable why U.N is keeping a blind with regard to this matter.

In recent years, It seems as if U.N has only become a fake organization, which behind the veil of human rights agenda is actually only working for Agendas of the world powers.
