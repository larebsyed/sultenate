On Tuesday, 13 March 2018, FIFA decided to lift the ban on PFF which it had enforced last year. FIFA had banned PFF due to the political intrusion in boards internal affair.

The ban came as an outcome of Lahore High Court's appointment of an administrator over boards internal matters.

FIFA does not allow political meddling in regional fedrations.

The court has￼ now removed is administrator from PFF office and transfered control back to PFF officials.
<p class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Consequently, FIFA says “the suspension of the PFF is lifted with immediate effect. This means that all of PFF’s membership rights have been reinstated, as defined in art. 13 of the FIFA Statutes, with immediate effect. PFF’s representative and club teams are again entitled to take part in international competitions.</span></p>

<p class="" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">“PFF’s members and officials may benefit from development programmes, courses and training from FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). Finally, FIFA member associations may again enter into sporting contact with PFF and/or its teams,” an excerpt from a FIFA-issued statement reads.</span></p>
