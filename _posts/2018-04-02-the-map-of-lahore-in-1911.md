<h6>Historical Lahore&nbsp;</h6>
Lahore Fort is at the heart of the city.&nbsp;

Canal can be seen dividing the two sections of Lahore back in 1909. On one side are the British settlement (Cantonment)&nbsp; now known as Lahore Cantt. On the other side, is the today's old Lahore. Areas like Muzang and Anarkali are still there.&nbsp;

Ichra can be seen in the lower part of the map.
